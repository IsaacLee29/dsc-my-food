# myFood

myFood is a mobile application that provides a platform that allows users to donate food or money for the people who are suffering from hunger.

## Goals

By developing this mobile application, the goal we intend to achieve is **Goal 2, Zero Hunger**, where we can end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture, as we seek to address and provide our solution to 1 of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals of the United Nations.

## Inspiration

We hope the development of this mobile app may encourage society to help out the needy by easing the process of helping and reaching out to these people, especially during these times where many people are challenged to even acquiring the basic needs essential for survival.

## Mobile Application

We decided to develop our mobile application by using the _Flutter Framework_ as it provides cross-platform capabilities, is relatively lightweight and integrates well with _Firebase_.

Our application generally consist of 5 main components/pages:
1. Home Page

    - A component that displays donations made, donation goals met and discovering events around us.
2. Discovering Page

    - A component that displays options to discover food banks around you and provide donating food to others.
3. Map Page

    - A component that displays a map that locates nearby food banks.
4. Donation Page

    - A component that displays options to support the needy through means of monetary donations.
5. Settings Page
    
    - A component that displays options to view current profile, change app themes and quit the app.
